DocBook XML source for hand-written OpenDJ core user documentation.
Javadoc and generated reference documentation are taken as artifacts
from OpenDJ server and SDK projects.

Note to writers:
Do not use Olinks between SDK docs and server docs
because the SDK docs and server docs can be delivered separately.
